# Python Coincidence Analyzer for Metamask
A simple Python coincidence searcher. You have to provide your metamask log.
Used this for determining to which web3 scammy website you have connected, and therefore compromised.

# How it works?
Put in the same directory of the project your two .json file that you have downloanded from metamask,
then run with python the 'main.py', the coincidences found in common in the two files while be 
outputed to 'result.txt'

## Why it was created?
A while ago I've got my metamask account compromised and some assets stolen, same happened to a close friend around the same dates ðŸ‘“, so i had the hypothesis that 
maybe we connected to the same website. The questions was finding that website, so in order to get that i created this small project. Feel free to take some inspiration and let me know if it helped you.
