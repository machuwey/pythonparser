# Python Coincidence Analyzer for Metamask
A simple Python coincidence searcher. You have to provide your metamask log.
Used this for determining web3 scammy websites after getting compromised.

# How it works?
Put in the same directory of the project your two .json file that you have downloanded from metamask,
then run with python the 'main.py', the coincidences found in common in the two files while be 
outputed to 'result.txt'
